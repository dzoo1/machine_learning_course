# Welcome to the Machine Learning Course!
Click on Introduction.ipynb to get started.

Before the course starts, please make sure you have installed the necessary software and packages. You can find them in the notebook. Doing this means we can get to the interesting stuff straight away once the sessions begin!

The easiest way of having the necessary packages is to install the most recent version Anaconda. If you're having trouble with installation, come to the session from 6:30pm for help setting up. See you there!
